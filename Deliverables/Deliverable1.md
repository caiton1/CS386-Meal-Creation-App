## Introduction:



Initial value proposition and customer segments:

### (i) Value Proposition: 
Our product is a meal customization and organization website emphasizing user customization. The target customer for our product is generally for people who cook at home that struggle with all the parts that lead up to cooking such as planning what meals to eat as well as what and how much to buy at the grocery store. This would probably lean towards the 18 – 30-year-old range as they have less cooking experience. The value our product provides is the personal customization that people desire when cooking and eating. While they are easily able to filter different allergies or dietary restrictions, the product will find the item the customer needs at the grocery store and add it to a list so they don’t have to. There may be some websites and apps that help people organize what they eat, and some services like “Hello Fresh” that give people pre-packaged meals. But what they lack and what makes our product unique is the mixture of the two. Our product combines the organization of the apps with the convenience of the grocery services, while also letting the customer be as personal as possible with what they are eating.

### (ii) Customer segment:
* People Who Cook for Themselves/Family 
* College Students 
* Busy Families 
* People New to Cooking 
* Meal Preppers 
* Budget Shoppers

## Interviews summary:
Some ideas to add to our project were to add a feature for what a person is craving, for example, if someone wants a meal with a specific ingredient such as chicken, potatoes, lemon, etc. they can specify that and get recipes with those specific ingredients. 

Interview 1: Nat H. is a college student who loves to cook. They said the website would be “nice to have”. They suggested that we should also give people snack recipes, in case someone just wants to eat something small, or in case they have a party coming up and want to make snacks or themed snacks (Halloween, Christmas, summer, etc.).

Interview 2: Michael C. is a college student who does not like cooking and goes to the gym. He said the website would be “nice to have”. He suggested that we create a feature for cravings. For example, if someone wants a dish with chicken, potatoes, lemon, peanut butter, etc. they can specify that. The website will then recommend dishes with one or more specified ingredients.

Interview 3: McKaela A. is a college student who prefers to cook at home over eating out. She has an interest in our product because it could help her find meals that avoid her allergies of nuts. When asked about the various elements that our product would have, she had a positive opinion towards the filtering element of our product. But when it came to the grocery element of the product, she was concerned on if our website/app would be able to take into consideration that the user may want specific ingredients, for example a regular bell pepper versus an organic one.

Interview 4: Marc M. is a college student who prefers to cook at home over out. He said he does have interest in the product because it could potentially help him pick meals that would fufill his macro needs, more specifically calorically dense meals with high amounts of protein. When asked about the various elements or our product, he said that he was specifically interested in the filtering element for it would help him quickly find a recipe that he would want to use, but he was concerned about the functionality of our product and how it would be able to adequate give the user accurate information about the recipes and ingredients.

Interview 5: Marquez R. is a college student who likes to save money by cooking at home. He said he has interest in the product because it would help him find meals that have high amounts of protein with low amounts of calories because he is an avid lifter attempting to lose body fat through a cut.
