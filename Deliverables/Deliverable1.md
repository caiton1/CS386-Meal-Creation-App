## Introduction:
  Pick My Meals is a meal customization and organization website emphasizing user customization. The target customer for our product is generally for people who cook at home that struggle with all the parts that lead up to cooking such as planning what meals to eat as well as what and how much to buy at the grocery store. The value our product provides is the personal customization that people desire when cooking and eating. While they are easily able to filter different allergies or dietary restrictions, the product will find the item the customer needs at the grocery store and add it to a list so they don’t have to. There may be some websites and apps that help people organize what they eat, and some services like “Hello Fresh” that give people pre-packaged meals. But what they lack and what makes our product unique is the mixture of the two. Our product combines the organization of the apps with the convenience of the grocery services, while also letting the customer be as personal as possible with what they are eating. With so many different options to choose from when fueling your body, why limit yourself?

## Interviews summary:
Some ideas to add to our project were to add a feature for what a person is craving, for example, if someone wants a meal with a specific ingredient such as chicken, potatoes, lemon, etc. they can specify that and get recipes with those specific ingredients. 

**Interview 1:** Interviewed by Sophia Ingram, 09/12/23  
Nat H. is a college student who loves to cook. They said the website would be “nice to have”. They suggested that we should also give people snack recipes, in case someone just wants to eat something small, or in case they have a party coming up and want to make snacks or themed snacks (Halloween, Christmas, summer, etc.).  
<ins> Direct Quote</ins>: “I think adding snacks would be a good idea because a lot of the times I don’t want a meal, I just want something small”

**Interview 2:** Interviewed by Sophia Ingram, 09/12/23  
Michael C. is a college student who does not like cooking and goes to the gym. He said the website would be “nice to have”. He suggested that we create a feature for cravings. For example, if someone wants a dish with chicken, potatoes, lemon, peanut butter, etc. they can specify that. The website will then recommend dishes with one or more specified ingredients.  
<ins> Direct Quote</ins>: “You should make a feature that will allow people to add what they are craving”

**Interview 3:** Interviewed by Connor Aiton, 09/13/23
McKaela A. is a college student who prefers to cook at home over eating out. She has an interest in our product because it could help her find meals that avoid her allergies of 
nuts. When asked about the various elements that our product would have, she had a positive opinion towards the filtering element of our product. But when it came to the grocery element of the product, she was concerned on if our website/app would be able to take into consideration that the user may want specific ingredients, for example a regular bell pepper versus an organic one.  
<ins> Direct Quote</ins> : "How will you select the right or best groceries?"
Assessment: Nice to have.

**Interview 4:** Interviewed by Jared Brotamonte, 9/12/23  
Marc M. is a college student who prefers to cook at home over out. He said he does have interest in the product because it could potentially help him pick meals that would fufill his macro needs, more specifically calorically dense meals with high amounts of protein. When asked about the various elements or our product, he said that he was specifically interested in the filtering element for it would help him quickly find a recipe that he would want to use, but he was concerned about the functionality of our product and how it would be able to adequate give the user accurate information about the recipes and ingredients. Overall, he sees our product as something that could be a “Must have” because not only would it help with time management, but also help with his macro-management.  
<ins> Direct Quote</ins>: “I am conscious of the foods I take in and having a busy schedule, thus having an app that filters out options for me would be beneficial to me both in giving me an appropriate recipe and saving me time.”

**Interview 5:** Interviewed by Jared Brotamonte, 9/12/23  
Marquez R. is a college student who likes to save money by cooking at home. He said he has interest in the product because it would help him find meals that have high amounts of protein with low amounts of calories because he is an avid lifter attempting to lose body fat through a cut. He was especially interested in the meal planning aspect of our product but was intrigued by how it would function. Overall, he sees our product as a “Nice to have” because although it has many features that could benefit him, he wonders if it’s enough to make him switch from using his other various apps like “MyFitnessPal”.  
<ins> Direct Quote</ins>: “I wonder if your app would be able to take into account the total macros of multiple meals throughout the day because as you said, the app would allow a user to input the number of meals they wanted to get.”

**Interview 6:** Interviewed by Isaiah Swank, 09/14/23  
Ryan O. is a college student who actively ice skates and lives in an apartment off campus. She showed interest in the website as she is new to living on her own and is cooking for herself for the first time. She mentioned that she has a little cooking experience but has a hard time trying to make new things while balancing other parts of her life. Her “must haves” were that the recipes be easy to follow, and that there be a nutritional facts part to make sure she is eating semi-healthy. She liked the idea of a filtering system and said we should add a section for favorite ingredients or food, not just foods you don’t like. Overall she said the website is “nice to have” at the moment.  
<ins> Direct Quote</ins>: “I think it’s a good idea! Since I am cooking for myself I hope it calculates how to buy for one person too.”

**Interview 7:** Interviewed by Isaiah Swank, 09/14/23  
Ethan M. is a college student who is currently living in the dorms. At the moment he said an application like this wouldn’t be of much use because of his living situation but he sees the value if he were to have a kitchen. He says that having access to a resource like this would encourage him to cook more on his own as it would take away the dead time and thinking between meals. If he were to use the website, something that he considers a “need to have” is a nutrient section showing the calories and such for each meal. Without the nutrition part yet and lack of kitchen, he considers the product to be a “nice to have” at the moment with “must have” potential.   
<ins> Direct Quote</ins>: “It sounds nice, but since I don’t have a kitchen myself it isn’t really useful until I get off of campus”

**Interview 8:** Interviewed by Isaiah Swank, 09/14/23  
Abbie M. is a 30 year old mother to be, living in Flagstaff. She plans to be a stay at home mom while raising her kids and cooks for her husband currently. She sees the website as “nice to have” as she already uses Pintrest quite often to find recipes and is adept at cooking. She mentioned that this would’ve been more useful when she was younger and learning to budget and cook. She liked the filtering for the dietary options and mentioned that it would be nice to have a feature to pertain to babies for new mothers.   
<ins> Direct Quote</ins>: “I don’t really think that I would need this now, maybe if there was some stuff for babies later down the line. I would have liked this a lot more when I was fresh out of college though."

**Interview 9:** Interviewed by Isaiah Swank, 09/14/23  
Nate B. is a third year college student living off campus while working and going to school. He said the website makes him skeptical since he in not online all the time and would prefer it to be in the form of an app instead to be on the go. He emphasized that the product would help his busy lifestyle as he has little time to plan his meals and grocery store trips. Nate mentioned as a “must have” that there be nutritional facts listed, and the total cost of the grocery bill be on there to help people budget. The filtering for diets, allergies, and non liked foods was a big aspect for him as well because he has some different allergies which can make shopping and cooking repetitive.   
<ins> Direct Quote</ins>: “I really wish this was an app because it would be way easier to do this from my phone but I really like the idea. It would be useful to have something to help me plan out meals I would actually want without having to do a bunch of looking and shopping around.”
