## 6. Use Cases

### Case Descriptions and Interface Sketch
The customers will have the ability to upload their own recipes. They can do this by uploading either a PDF document, or entering a text box. They will then have the option to include recipe specifications such as 
“vegetarian” or “keto” that way it is easier for other customers to get recommended their recipes.

The developers will create a system that is easy for consumers to use. They will do this by having each new customer complete a quick questionnaire. Questions will ask about the user's specific diet, such as; vegan,
peanut allergy, high protein, keto, etc.

The developers will use the customer’s location, if the customer permits, by having the customer allow the location permission in settings. Once the customer’s have shared their 
location with the website it will use that information to find the closest store to the customer.

The developers will implement a system to find stores close to the customer using their location, they will then look through the closest stores stock and see what ingredients they have. 
They will then compare the prices to the second closest stores prices to find the most affordable ingredients.
