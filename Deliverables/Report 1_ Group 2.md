## 3. Next Steps


Meeting schedule: Wednesday’s at 12:00


Decision making process: Majority by ⅔’s


Project Idea:  An (web) app or website that takes in a specified number of meals, allergy restrictions, and diets and gives the user an option to say yes or no on given recipes until the amount is satisfied. It will then calculate the cost of the grocery bill of the meals you selected while taking you to an online grocery store to check out.


Project Scope Remarks: The scope of this project is not too big, a couple of months. As of now it seems like we will be able to get the project done within the designated time, which is before the semester ends.


Project Name: Pick My Meals




Technology Stack:
* Version Control: Git
* Infrastructure: AWS and Terraform OR other hosting service OR host locally?
* Languages: Python, C/C++, JS, HTML/CSS and related packages to a web app


We aren’t entirely sure what technologies we are going to use quite yet, knowing that we are going to be developing a website we know that HTML/CSS and JS are going to be important as well as the section required to be written in C or C++. As far as infrastructure we are going to try and see as we go which one we should use. We plan on figuring this out by utilizing Youtube tutorials, W3schools, and other online coding resources to reference when we get stuck.
