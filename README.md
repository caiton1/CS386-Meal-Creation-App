# CS386-Meal-Creation-App-WIP-
Our product Pick-My-Meals is a free website that allows users to personally curate meals that fulfill their dietary needs through the use of custom filters. These filters allow users to select specific dietary needs or ingredients, that way they are provided with unique recipes. Unlike Hello Fresh our product is completely driven by user customization while not locking customers into frustrating subscriptions. Our product handles the grocery list by utilizing the customerâ€™s location in order to find stores closest to them. Once a store is selected our product takes care of curating the grocery cart, saving the user time and money. This project will use teamwork and impliment software engineering concepts.  

## Status
Our meal creation app is still being developed. We are currently working on creating a backend infastructure for our website.

## Setup
So far we have decided on using google cloud as our backend and use mainly python for this project for its ease of use and versatility. However we will use JS and C as we see fit either due to requrinments or better support.

*More details and information to come later as development progresses.*
