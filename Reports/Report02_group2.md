##1. Summary of activities

Aiden Seay - Sent out the interview questions to my group. I am awaiting responses. Should get responses by the end of the week to complete the deliverable due this Sunday.

Connor Aiton - Sent out the interview form/survey to others, I got a few successful submissions that will be reflected in the forms. I formatted the last report into mark down and posted it on the github repo under the deliverables folder.

Sophia Ingram - I have spent the past week interviewing people to receive feedback on our project. I was able to interview 5 people and received some good feedback on what could improve the app as well as information on whether we should scrap our idea or keep it.

Elleana Negrelli - Sent out google forms to peers for feedback. If there are not enough responses in the form in the upcoming days, I will follow-up with those who were sent the form and interview people in person.

Jared Brotamonte - I have sent out a variety of questions via google forms to a few peers. I have received two responses but am waiting to hear from a few more.

During this meeting we discussed the results of our interviews and decided what we should change about our idea based on the feedback. We also worked on our first deliverable.We were also working on setting up git on everyone's computers so we can work on the deliverables

##2. Project retrospective

Appreciations: Connor helped everyone get their GitHub repos set-up since he knows the most about it, he was able to resolve a lot of the errors team members were receiving
Successes: We were able to get all of the team to clone the repository to their local device, and create and pull a new branch. We also worked on Deliverable 1 and discussed the interviewing process thus far.
Failures: We had a hard time getting GitHub to work on some of our local machines
Barriers: One of the barriers has been getting everyone set up on GitHub since most of us are not yet familiar with the platform. Once we get more comfortable with it things should go smoother. 
What we should try next time: Next time we will try to be more familiar with GitHub and start on setting up a website. We could try finding resources to familiarize ourselves with the programs we will be using going forward with this project.


##3. Next Steps
Meeting schedule: Wednesday’s at 12:00

Decision making process: Majority by ⅔’s

Our next step is to create a website. We will get a server to host our website as well as a DNS. We are also planning on learning more about GitHub as well as getting everyone set-up on it so that we can use it to create our reports and deliverables.
