# 2. Project retrospective  
The project retrospective is an opportunity for the group and each individual to reflect on their experience with the project and improve the way the group works together. Make at least five lists:
1. Appreciations: highlights of contributions from team members
    * Isaiah helped set up the template for the reports. He then sent it to us for us to work on before our meeting. 


1. Successes: what went well  
    * Everyone dove into the deliverable, with each person working on a specific part. 
    * After working on their own part, everyone also gave good feedback on the parts that others worked on which helped create a better deliverable.


1. Failures: what did not go well  
    * When creating the documents, some people did not have access to them at first due to misspelling in the email address when sharing the documents.


1. Barriers: things that are blocking the maximum performance of the team  
    * We found that when submitting the reports to Canvas, some of the team members have trouble getting the information from the Github to Canvas without all of it still being in Markdown.


1. What we should try next time.  
    * Make sure that everyone has access to the needed documents BEFORE the meeting starts so that we don’t find that out later on.  
    * Make a more organized list of what each person could be working on so that there isn’t a log jam in deciding on what each person should do.  

# 3. Next steps  
We will:    

* Work on completing Deliverable 2.   
* Updating Deliverable 2 to the Github page.  
* Upload Report 4 to GitHub and then submit to Canvas
