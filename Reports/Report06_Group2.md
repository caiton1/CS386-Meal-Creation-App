## 1. Summary of Activities  
**Group:** Created a list of classes with attributes that are associated with them on the whiteboard so we can start making the UML class diagram. 

**Connor Aiton:** Suggested classes for the diagram and related attributes for the deliverable. Will be working on setting up a cost effective/simple infrastructure to run the website and database on.  

**Jared Brotamonte:** Helped the team create lists of classes and a list of attributes towards those classes for deliverable 3. 

**Sophia Ingram:** I wrote our textual description of our system describing the key requirements of the system making sure to include the stakeholders and keeping it true to our user stories, bolding and italicizing when needed. I also worked on listing our classes, their attributes, and those attributes values; that way it is clear what each one is for.   

**Elleana Negrelli:** Helped brainstorm to create classes and attributes for the UML diagrams. 

**Aiden Seay:** Helped list and describe all of the attributes that will be in each class in our UML class diagram. This class diagram will be used in deliverable 3. Added the weekly report to GitHub.

**Isaiah Swank:** Sorted all the classes with their corresponding attributes and wrote them out on the whiteboard. Also wrote the opening paragraph of the system description.

## 2. Project Retrospective
1. Appreciations: highlights of contributions from team members
    * Isaiah helped sort all of the classes that will be used in the UML class diagram on the whiteboard.

2. Successes: what went well
    * We had a very productive meeting where we created the classes needed for the UML class diagram. 

3. Failures: what did not go well
    * We need to be more specific on our deliverables and better format them so it looks more professional. 

4. Barriers: things that are blocking the maximum performance of the team
    * It is hard to figure out what is needed when we donâ€™t have any examples to follow.

7. What we should try next time.
    * Asking the teacher more questions so that the requirements are clearer to us.

## 3. Next Steps  
**We will:**
 * Finish working on our third deliverable. We need to create the UML diagram and finish up some edits on our system description.
 * Upload everything to GitHub with everyone making a small contribution. Not adding it all in the last minute.
 * Start on coding our project. We will first start off getting a web server set-up with a domain.
