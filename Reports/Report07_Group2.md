# 1. Summary of Activities  
**Connor Aiton:** Initially filled out first draft of midterm slides from deliverables. Created the final iteration of UML use case diagram. Created licensing for the project and updated README to better align with the project details. Fixed past deliverables to also better align with current deliverables.   

**Jared Brotamonte:** Worked on the midterm presentation, and wrote a script to use for the user stories slide.  

**Sophia Ingram:** Worked on our midterm presentation. I simplified the value proposition so that it could be presented as bullet points, then reviewed it to make sure we got all of our points across.  

**Elleana Negrelli:** Worked on slides for the presentation. Focused on the problem statement slide and formatting the presentation to look good.   

**Aiden Seay:** Worked on the midterm presentation and fixed up the functional requirements slide. I helped simplify the points on the presentation so that it is more readable. Figured out what we need to do to be successful on our next deliverable. Started the md files for CODE_OF_CONDUCT and CONTRIBUTING.   

**Isaiah Swank:** Created the To-Do list for the meeting, and helped organize who would do what slide for the presentation. Combed through the instructions for Deliverable 4 and reorganized it into a document that the team could access and easily understand. Discussed what part of the programming I would be doing until the next meeting.
