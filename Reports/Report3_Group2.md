# 1. Summary of activities
**Sophia I:** I updated the deliverable so that it was properly formatted and submitted the deliverable for the group. I also fixed up my interview section of the report to meet all the assignment requirements.  

**Connor Aiton:** Assisted the group in setting up git on their computers and using git. Spent additional time creating a guide on using git in context to our project and how the project repo is structured. Ensured that the deliverable and reports were properly formatted for submission and grading.  

**Jared Brotamonte:** I updated the deliverable so that the interviews were up to the standard that assignment required.  

**Aiden Seay:** Formatted the deliverable on markdown so it looked better. Added interview information for the deliverable so it meets all assignment specifications.   

**Isaiah Swank:** I was sick and missed the last meeting, in the meantime I updated the deliverable for the introduction, the IVP and consumer segments, and the FVP and consumer segments. I also did four interviews and edited them into the deliverable as well.  

**Elleana Negrelli:** I worked on drafting the first deliverable before we created the markdown file so we could all collaborate on the same document before uploading it to github. I reviewed the deliverable as edits were made to make sure it met the requirements in Canvas.  

# 2. Project retrospective
The group has been working well together, we have managed to stay on top of everything and everyone in the group has been contributing. We did notice that how we were using GitHub was not working for everyone in the group. In the beginning we had each made our own branch that we would push and pull from before pushing our changes to main. We decided that instead of everyone having their own branch we would instead make one branch for all of us to push to, and then we would push the changes made to that branch onto main. One of the aspects that works very well for the group dynamics is having a member in the group that is experienced with GitHub. Since Connor knows a lot about it he has been able to help everyone in the group when it comes to using GitHub.  


The project retrospective is an opportunity for the group and each individual to reflect on their experience with the project and improve the way the group works together. Make at least five lists:
1. Appreciations: highlights of contributions from team members
    * Connor helped organize a guide for team members on how to use Git in a more efficient way as a team.
    * Aiden scheduled a private room in the library for this meeting so we could better focus.
1. Successes: what went well
    * Working in the library as opposed to the Union
    * Creating a separate “Dev” branch and getting rid of everyone’s individual branches
1. Failures: what did not go well
    * Isaiah (me) being sick for the last meeting led to some miscommunication for what needed to be done for the deliverable and what to update into the Github.
1. Barriers: things that are blocking the maximum performance of the team
    * There is a difference between the overall git knowledge throughout the team. Thus those of us that have lacking experience with git work in a slower manner and have to ask for more help from others.
    * What we should try next time.
    * We should have those who are not as experienced with Git practice outside of the meetings
# 3. Next steps
Fix the GitHub branches in our repository. We were going back and forth on how we wanted our branches to function. We have completed all of our work so far. The next thing we have to work on is deliverable 2 which is working on problem and positioning statements. We will also need to make a list of all the stakeholders. We also need to make a list of the feature requirements for our website, and list the requirements as functional or non-functional.  

We will:    

* Work on our MVP (minimum viable product) so that we can plan how our product will be tested
* Work on creating our UML use case diagram
* One complete use case description for each member of the group
* Two user stories for each member of the group
* We will also screenshot our issue tracker if anything arises
