# Deliverable 4 : Group 2 Implementaion 1

## Introduction

The problem of planning meals throughout the busy week, especially with all the different dietary restrictions, affects everyone from on the go college students to young families. These issues cost people time, physical health, mental health, and performance in other aspects of their lives. Our product Pick-My-Meals is a free website that allows users to personally curate meals that fulfill their dietary needs through the use of custom filters. These filters allow users to select specific dietary needs or ingredients, that way they are provided with unique recipes. Unlike Hello Fresh our product is completely driven by user customization while not locking customers into frustrating subscriptions. Our product handles the grocery list by utilizing the customerâ€™s location in order to find stores closest to them. Once a store is selected our product takes care of curating the grocery cart, saving the user time and money.
