# Deliverable 7: Group 2  

## Description    
Our website provides a user-friendly platform for discovering and selecting unique recipes. In addition to standard features like instructions and nutritional information, our standout feature is the recipe recommendation tool. Catering to users uncertain about their culinary preferences, it presents a variety of recipes from our extensive database, allowing users to accept or decline suggestions. Accepted recipes integrate into a user's planned list, enhancing meal preparation organization.  

What sets us apart further are our advanced filters. In addition to traditional sorting options, our platform offers unique filters such as calorie count, beneficial for those adhering to specific dietary restrictions. Our pricing filter dynamically calculates recipe costs based on current grocery store prices, aiding users in managing their budgets efficiently. The platform also accommodates dietary restrictions, including allergies. With an emphasis on user-friendliness, our product eliminates subscription and shipping costs, offering a vast selection of recipes, customizable meals, and the flexibility for users to choose their preferred ingredient sources.

**Reflection:**  
Through watching the user navigate the website and complete the given tasks I found that our website is easy to use and has features that users like. My tester got excited when he saw that the ingredients all had their estimated cost next to them, but he wished there was a total cost provided as well. He also liked the filters that we had since they are unique and convenient, being able to easily find affordable and high-calorie meals. However, he did say that he would have preferred it if it said specifically “sort from high to low” or vice versa. I would say that we have accomplished our value proposition. The website was user-friendly and offered unique features. My tester especially liked the random meal suggestions, he said it is a good way to easily discover new meals without having to put in any effort.
