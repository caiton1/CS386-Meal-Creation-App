# Deliverable 7: Group 2  

## Description    
Our website provides a user-friendly platform for discovering and selecting unique recipes. In addition to standard features like instructions and nutritional information, our standout feature is the recipe recommendation tool. Catering to users uncertain about their culinary preferences, it presents a variety of recipes from our extensive database, allowing users to accept or decline suggestions. Accepted recipes integrate into a user's planned list, enhancing meal preparation organization.  

What sets us apart further are our advanced filters. In addition to traditional sorting options, our platform offers unique filters such as calorie count, beneficial for those adhering to specific dietary restrictions. Our pricing filter dynamically calculates recipe costs based on current grocery store prices, aiding users in managing their budgets efficiently. The platform also accommodates dietary restrictions, including allergies. With an emphasis on user-friendliness, our product eliminates subscription and shipping costs, offering a vast selection of recipes, customizable meals, and the flexibility for users to choose their preferred ingredient sources.

**Reflection:**  
Through watching the user navigate the website and complete the given tasks I found that our website is easy to use and has features that users like. My tester got excited when he saw that the ingredients all had their estimated cost next to them, but he wished there was a total cost provided as well. He also liked the filters that we had since they are unique and convenient, being able to easily find affordable and high-calorie meals. However, he did say that he would have preferred it if it said specifically “sort from high to low” or vice versa. I would say that we have accomplished our value proposition. The website was user-friendly and offered unique features. My tester especially liked the random meal suggestions, he said it is a good way to easily discover new meals without having to put in any effort.

**Reflection:**  
I had my roommate Nate who I interviewed previously this semester about what he would want in Pick My Meals so we had a frame of reference from a user who would be interested in a product like this. He made an account easily and went directly to the recipe page. He enjoyed looking through the recipes and found the allergy filter easy to use to sort the recipes that would be available to him. He wished there were more recipes because after accounting for his allergy there was a fairly limited amount of available recipes. He reported that he liked the colors that we used for the website but noted that it could look a bit sharper with the fonts on the recipes. Overall he enjoyed the base website and is excited for what is to come. At the end of the day, while we are in the infancy of software deployment for our website I believe we have satisfied our value proposition. The website offers easy to use filtering and favoriting features that the testing user enjoyed, while still feeling unique from other competing websites. While there are some aspects that can be cleaned up, I like the spot where we are at.
