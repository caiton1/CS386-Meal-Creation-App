# 1. Summary of Activities  
**Sophia Ingram:** I worked on the introduction for deliverable #4 and made the project description on our readme file more descriptive, worked on the report, and made sure to assign each member to their corresponding issue.  

**Elleana Negrelli:** I worked on the deliverable document and attached appropriate links to the files in our github as well as each designated issue that we will be implementing for this deliverable. I started working on how to implement my assigned issue.   

**Aiden Seay:** Worked on deliverable and added initial edits to the README, CONTRIBUTING, LICENSE and CODE_OF_CONDUCT files. I started to work on how to implement the issue that I was assigned in GitHub.   

**Isaiah Swank:** Created and shared the report and deliverable documents. Researched and organized the starting recipe database. Helped the team organize who would be responsible for each section of the deliverable so nothing would be left out. Helped group mates decide how each issue should be turned into a coded function.

    * Working together as a team to split up work and get issues assigned  

1. Failures: what did not go well  
    * Working on deliverable 4 a few days before it was due, it put the whole team on a time crunch during a busy week for everybody  

1. Barriers: things that are blocking the maximum performance of the team
