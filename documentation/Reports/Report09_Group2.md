## 1. Summary of Activities

**Group:** Talked about how we can do better on our next deliverable. We worked on reviewing each other's code and made sure we were all on the same page. This is to make sure everyone knows how every part of the website works.

**Connor Aiton:** Created infrastructure for the project to run on including hosting service, database and authorization. Helped integrate everyone's code into the website and backend code. Created initial backend code to serve web pages dynamically.

**Jared Brotamonte:** Looked into the provided example diagrams for the “Architecture” portion of deliverable 5 and planned how to take those examples and apply them to our own project.

**Sophia Ingram:** Researched UML sequence diagrams that way I can accurately create one for deliverable 5, and uploaded the report to GitHub

**Elleana Negrelli:** Started working on design characteristics section for deliverable 5. Implemented the preference filter for the website.

**Aiden Seay:** Worked on the CONTRIBUTING file and edited the README file so that it is most up to date. Implemented the favoriting feature for deliverable 4 and implemented it into the website.

**Isaiah Swank:** Implemented the allergies search for the website and helped organize what person does what for the next deliverable so we are more successful and balanced. Created the instructions documents and markdown files for Deliverables 5 and 6, as well as set up and organized the Zoom meeting so those missing could still get their needed information. 



## 2. Project Retrospective  
1. Appreciations: highlights of contributions from team members  
    * Connor did very well setting up the infrastructure of the website. He also helped everyone with their requirements they had to complete.   


1. Successes: what went well  
    * Connor helping the group with deliverable 4 and ensuring that our code worked with the website  


1. Failures: what did not go well  
    * We waited till the last minute to work on and turn in deliverable 4. It was really stressful getting everything done in a timely manner.   


1. Barriers: things that are blocking the maximum performance of the team  
    * Knowing different languages, a lot of us do not know how to handle the back-end when it comes to the website, which makes it hard to get our requirements
      
1. What we should try next time.  
    * We are going to add an additional meeting each week to discuss and review each other’s code.   


# 3. Next Steps
We will:
* Split up work for Deliverable 5 and start working on that this week.
* Work on learning the backend for the website so we can do a better job on Deliverable 6.
