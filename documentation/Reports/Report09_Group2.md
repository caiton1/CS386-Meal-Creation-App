# 2. Project Retrospective  
1. Appreciations: highlights of contributions from team members  
    * Connor did very well setting up the infrastructure of the website. He also helped everyone with their requirements they had to complete.   


1. Successes: what went well  
    * Connor helping the group with deliverable 4 and ensuring that our code worked with the website  


1. Failures: what did not go well  
    * We waited till the last minute to work on and turn in deliverable 4. It was really stressful getting everything done in a timely manner.   


1. Barriers: things that are blocking the maximum performance of the team  
    * Knowing different languages, a lot of us do not know how to handle the back-end when it comes to the website, which makes it hard to get our requirements
      
1. What we should try next time.  
    * We are going to add an additional meeting each week to discuss and review each otherâ€™s code.   


# 3. Next Steps
We will:
* Split up work for Deliverable 5 and start working on that this week.
* Work on learning the backend for the website so we can do a better job on Deliverable 6.
