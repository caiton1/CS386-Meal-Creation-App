## 1. Summary of Activities

**Group:** We worked on making sure that our issues were relevant to our project so that we could be prepared for deliverable 6, we then assigned the issues to different group members.  

**Connor Aiton:** 

**Jared Brotamonte:** I worked on finishing the multi-layered UML package diagram for deliverable 5, and helped the team figure out the various issues we could work on for deliverable 6.

**Sophia Ingram:** I worked on finishing the UML sequence diagram for deliverable 5, I also simplified the introduction for the deliverable so that it could be one paragraph.

**Aiden Seay:** I worked on design patterns for deliverable 5. I also figured out what issue I would need to solve for deliverable 6. I need to work on the rating system for the website to determine how good a recipe is. 

**Isaiah Swank:** Checked the progress of everyone’s work for Deliverable 5 and organized how to help each team member. Created the updated class diagram with the new functions.
