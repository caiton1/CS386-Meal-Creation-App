## 1. Summary of Activities

**Group:** Worked on combining everyone’s implementations together on the website. 

**Connor Aiton:** Created and implemented the meal swipe feature For deliverable 6. Helped others better understand the backend code and possible approaches for accessing data from our database. Spent more time improving the quality of the repo and fixing any warnings or errors that were previously present, particularly in the unit testing.

**Jared Brotamonte:** Worked on the implementation of adjusting recipe information based on the desired serving size for deliverable 6. Almost done with testing as well just working out a few bugs.

**Sophia Ingram:** Created the “Report an Issue” button on the website and also added “Report” to the nav bar. Created the subject and body for users to write their issues.    

**Elleana Negrelli:** Worked on the implementation of a shopping list for deliverable 6. Finished most of the necessary functions and got feedback from the group on how to implement conversions for the list.

**Aiden Seay:** Worked on my part of the implementation for deliverable 6. Currently working on a rating system for all of the meals. Users will be able to give a thumbs up or thumbs down depending on if the meal is good or not. 

**Isaiah Swank:** Reconfigured the data for stores in the database to be more modular with the rest of the data types. Worked on the “choose_store” function that gets the wanted store from the user. Helped make sure everyone on the team was getting the help they needed. Uploaded the Github with the Report 11 file.

## 2. Project Retrospective  
1. Appreciations: Highlights of contributions from team members
   * Each team member came ready to the meeting to discuss their progress on the deliverable. 

2. Successes: What went well
   * Good communication with how each member was doing on their issue, problems were identified to multiple people so that we could solve them sooner.

4. Failures: What did not go well
   * Harder tasks in Deliverable 5 took time away to work on Deliverable 6.

6. Barriers: Things that are blocking the maximum performance of the team
   * Some of the functions and issues for this Deliverable intersect in code, making a couple group members need to work alot more along side each other.
      
7. What we should try next time.
   * Possibly schedule another meeting for the weekend to check and make sure everyone's work will get done.


# 3. Next Steps
We will:  
* Help each team member with issues they might have.
* Finish Deliverable 6.
