## 1. Summary of Activities

**Group:** Met as a team on Saturday to discuss the end of Deliverable 6 and the start of Deliverable 7.

**Connor Aiton:** Rolled back main to a working version and implemented the features that were working for the demo. Recorded the demo video and posted it. 

**Jared Brotamonte:** Finished the functions for adjusting the quantity and costs of the ingredients based on the desired serving size that the customer/user would want. But I need to work with Elleana to get it to implement into the website given it’ll work hand and hand with the shopping list.

**Sophia Ingram:** Finished creating an issues reporting system for our website for deliverable 6. I was able to get it successfully integrated into the website.

**Elleana Negrelli:** Finished the shopping list functions for deliverable 6 but still need to implement them in the website. I also reviewed what needs to be done for the final deliverable and presentation so we can get started on it.

**Aiden Seay:** Finished implementing the the rating system for the meals. Next thing I need to do is to actually implement it onto the website. I was also responsible for the formatting on deliverable 6.

**Isaiah Swank:** Finished my part of Deliverable 6 before leaving before Thanksgiving. Created the Deliverable 7 document and markdown file on the Github repository. Reserved the study room for next week's meeting. 

## 2. Project Retrospective  
1. Appreciations: Highlights of contributions from team members
   * Communication from the team while trying to navigate organizing a meeting and still getting our work done over Thanksgiving break.

2. Successes: What went well
   * After failing to meet Wednesday, we had a small virtual meeting Saturday where we discussed what we needed to do for Deliverable 7 and how to fix our site from what happened in Deliverable 6.

4. Failures: What did not go well
   * Failed meeting at our normal time on Wednesday due to travel conflicts.

6. Barriers: Things that are blocking the maximum performance of the team
   * The Thanksgiving holiday made it much harder to organize a time for the team to meet as each member had different availability due to travel.
      
7. What we should try next time.
   * Go back to our normal schedule of meeting at 12:00 on Wednesday’s in the library to have a more productive meeting.


## 3. Next Steps
We will:  
* Organize the workload for Deliverable 7
* Complete Deliverable 7 and any other work needed for the website
